## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
### Data Analysis Process
1. **Customer Insights**:
   - Query for top 10 customers by credit limit:
     ```sql
     SELECT customerName, creditLimit
     FROM customers
     ORDER BY creditLimit DESC
     LIMIT 10;
     ```
     **Interpretation**: Identifies high-value customers for priority engagement.

   - Query for customers without orders:
     ```sql
     SELECT customerName
     FROM customers
     WHERE customerNumber NOT IN (SELECT customerNumber FROM orders);
     ```
     **Interpretation**: Targets inactive customers for reactivation campaigns.

2. **Sales Analysis**:
   - Query for monthly sales revenue:
     ```sql
     SELECT DATE_FORMAT(orderDate, '%Y-%m') AS month, 
            SUM(orderdetails.quantityOrdered * orderdetails.priceEach) AS totalRevenue
     FROM orders
     JOIN orderdetails ON orders.orderNumber = orderdetails.orderNumber
     GROUP BY month;
     ```
     **Interpretation**: Provides insights into sales trends to plan seasonal promotions.

   - Query for the top 10 most profitable orders:
     ```sql
     SELECT o.orderNumber, SUM(od.quantityOrdered * od.priceEach) AS totalRevenue
     FROM orders o
     JOIN orderdetails od ON o.orderNumber = od.orderNumber
     GROUP BY o.orderNumber
     ORDER BY totalRevenue DESC
     LIMIT 10;
     ```
     **Interpretation**: Highlights high-revenue orders for benchmarking and replication.

3. **Product and Inventory Insights**:
   - Query for product sales summary:
     ```sql
     SELECT products.productName, 
            SUM(orderdetails.quantityOrdered) AS totalQuantitySold
     FROM products
     JOIN orderdetails ON products.productCode = orderdetails.productCode
     GROUP BY products.productName;
     ```
     **Interpretation**: Analyzes product sales performance to optimize inventory.

   - Query for popular product combinations:
     ```sql
     SELECT od1.productCode AS product1, od2.productCode AS product2, 
            COUNT(*) AS combinationCount
     FROM orderdetails od1
     JOIN orderdetails od2 ON od1.orderNumber = od2.orderNumber 
            AND od1.productCode < od2.productCode
     GROUP BY product1, product2
     ORDER BY combinationCount DESC;
     ```
     **Interpretation**: Identifies frequently purchased product pairs to improve bundling strategies.

4. **Automation with Triggers**:
   - Trigger to update customer credit limit after new orders:
     ```sql
     CREATE TRIGGER update_credit_limit AFTER INSERT ON orders
     FOR EACH ROW
     BEGIN
         UPDATE customers
         SET creditLimit = creditLimit - NEW.orderTotal
         WHERE customerNumber = NEW.customerNumber;
     END;
     ```
     **Interpretation**: Automates credit limit adjustments, enhancing operational efficiency.

   - Trigger to log product quantity changes:
     ```sql
     CREATE TRIGGER log_quantity_changes AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON orderdetails
     FOR EACH ROW
     BEGIN
         INSERT INTO product_quantity_log (orderNumber, productCode, oldQuantity, newQuantity, changeDate)
         VALUES (NEW.orderNumber, NEW.productCode, OLD.quantityOrdered, NEW.quantityOrdered, NOW());
     END;
     ```
     **Interpretation**: Tracks changes in product quantities for better inventory management.
